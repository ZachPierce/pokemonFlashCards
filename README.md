# PVFlashCards

PVFlashCards is a basic single page react app that simulates a flash card type studying environment using data from `pogo-api`. This app specifically is focused on studying pokemon, their typing, weaknesses, and resistances to help with performance in the PVP Battle Leagues of PokemonGo. It is assumed that most of the traffic to a web app like this one will be via a mobile device so the ui/ux is heavily infulenced by that. Hope you enjoy!
